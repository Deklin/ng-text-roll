# ng-text-roll
An AngularJS directive that highlights string changes by “rolling” characters.

Although I have some experience with writing AngularJS directives, this is my first published bower
component so please be gentle! :)  I am very open to suggestions and feedback and appreciate it in advance.

Please note: at current state, I am trying to figure out how to incorporate the directive’s markup 
into the $templateCache as the directive is throwing a “Failed to load template” error.
