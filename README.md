# ng-text-roll
An AngularJS directive that highlights string changes by “rolling” characters.

Although I have some experience with writing AngularJS directives, this is my first published bower
component so please be gentle! :)  I am very open to suggestions and feedback and appreciate it in advance.

#### Install with Bower
```sh
$ bower install ng-text-roll
```
